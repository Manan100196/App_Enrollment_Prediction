# App_Enrollment_Prediction

The dataset captures the app usage behavior of customers. It provides valuable insights into how users interact with the app, enabling us to analyze user engagement and strategize targeted actions to enhance their experience. Here's an overview of the data:

The dataset includes detailed records of app behavior for each user, focusing specifically on their first day of app usage. It logs the date and time of app installation, as well as the features and functionalities that the user interacted with during this period.
App behavior is further broken down into:
- The specific screens the user navigated to within the app.
- Whether or not the user engaged with financial mini-games available in the app.

The data collection is intentionally limited to the first 24 hours of app usage. This timeframe aligns with the company’s free trial policy, which allows users to access premium features without charge during this period. By analyzing first-day data, the company aims to identify high-potential users and craft targeted offers to encourage them to transition to a paid subscription after the trial ends.
